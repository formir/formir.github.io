  <h1>Getting Started <small>formir - pure css framework</small></h1>
  <article class="section section-content with-padding">
    <p class="has-tooltip" data-tooltip="but some of cases will be necessary, I will give you know">Formir is a
      framework that not require any JS code to fully work</p>
    <p>All of logic are based on CSS and <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> tag elements, thats are required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> tag has a three very important attribute for Formir, there is: <code>name</code>,
      <code>id</code>, and <code>for</code>
      <br />
      <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> is part of form on your website, but we can hide this elements and control all
      other elements that are directly <code>+</code> or indirectly <code>~</code> behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To start working with Formir, you mast know that all elements <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> ascending one group
      must have the same name, for example all <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> in component 'tabs' have to set the same
      <code>name</code> attribute.
      <br />
      Parts of Formir components have to also set <code>id</code> attribute for each <code>&#x3C;input/&#x3E;</code> and
      have his own <code>&#x3C;label/&#x3E;</code>
      with associated <code>for</code> attribute (the same as <code>id</code>)
    </p>

  <h2>Get Formir</h2>
  <article class="section section-content with-padding">
    <p>Install with npm: <code>npm install --save-dev formir</code></p>
    <p>Install with yarn: <code>yarn install -D formir</code></p>
  </article>

  <h2>Use Formir</h2>
  <article class="section section-content with-padding">
    <p>javascript module:</p>
    <p><code>import "formir";</code></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>less compiler with npm:</p>
    <p><code>@import "formir";</code></p>
  </article>

  <h2>Setup Formir</h2>
  <article class="section section-content with-padding">
    <p>Formir is written on LESS. Files are split by core elements, template elements that are an extension to the core,
      and application files that will be not part of a component of formir but it will be your own styles.</p>
    <p>Start with install or copy framework files to own direction. All files are included in file:
      <code>less/formir.less</code> you could also use the example of application in file <code>application.less</code>
      - this is a compilation for this page. All start with this file - you could remove or change the direction, copy
      from vendor to your direction and modify.
    </p>
    <p>All classes used on this framework is customizable to prevent name collision -
      <code>less/setup/classes.less</code>
    </p>
    <p>All core variables - the most important for all components are store in - <code>less/setup/core.less</code> for
      example number of columns for the grid, or unit for each dimension variables, RWD breaking points.</p>
    <p>All other variables for each components are store in - <code>less/setup/variables.less</code>.</p>
    <p>Mixins are store in direction - <code>less/core/mixins/</code> there is a lot of prefix function.</p>
    <p>In the core there is a logic of CSS, we don't recommend changing these files, use variables or templates file
      mixins (each component's template has owned class mixin to do the job) - but feel free if such a need arises.
      Remember to copy all files that will be changed from node_modules and change the include direction..</p>
